Use file 'neural network' to run and estimate new values based off of previous data. 
File 'data_file_interpret' is used to interpret data from the csv file.
File 'data' hold the current partial data from the expedition.

File 'neural network' is heavily based off of the guide here (https://stackabuse.com/creating-a-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python/), and I can claim little originality for the code.
